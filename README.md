# IBM Color Picker

> A Google Chrome extension eye dropper tool for IBM Design colors.

If you're someone who works with IBM colors often, you might have a hex to IBM color and tone cheatsheet with you at all times. That way when you're working with a design where all you get is hex values, you can determine which Sass mixin you need to get that same color.

Worry not! This tool will help get IBM specific color information from any website, image, or app in Google Chrome.
